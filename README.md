I am Micha≈Ç Plaszczak

I have found myself especially in creating front-end web applications however the building responsive websides also makes me fun. I have completed the Individual Front-end Development Course with an experienced mentor Mateusz Bogolubow - [devmentor.pl](devmentor.pl).

What I am currently devoting to?

- I'm delving into React.
- I'm looking for a job to create amazing apps and webs, as well as to develop my skills that will benefit in the further work .

What else makes me fun?

- when I cook and create my own recipes.
- gym thanks to which I developed my knowledge of dietetics

I am an appropriate person if you are looking for the employee who:

- has a high sense of responsibility,
- is open to constructive criticism and is able to draw conclusions from it
